Brennan O'Rear:

It  still needs demonstration and formalization, but it is further than I have
previously reached intuitively, theoretically, or analytically. Reassuring to
see that my intellect may not be in so rapid decline as I had imagined.

Anyway, it’s more a synthesis than breaking new ground, but if I it can be
borne out experimentally, and I have some idea how, it would lend coherence to
a few things.

Enough prelude. Here’s the hypothesis: the fundamental elements of complexity
are recursion, compression, and entropy.

That is, complex adaptive systems (biological, computational, etc) result from
the generative interplay of these three universal forces.

The interplay generates emergent complexity across scales and substrates.
Evolution by natural selection is a special case of this more fundamental
trans-systemic triad, as true for machine learning as for genetics.

It’s a hypothesis I came to intuitively, but it turns out to have a mountain of
theoretical grounding. It’s just that fields that consider these things don’t
usually talk to each other, and even when they do, it’s tricky to think through
how one might demonstrate this.

But yeah, I feel reasonably confident with just compression, entropy, and
recursion, you can generate the whole cathedral of complex adaptive
systems—gradient flow, variation, dissipation, selection, heredity, leverage,
interdependence, network topology, and emergence.

The next step would be to create a concrete simulation, I’m thinking a Python
model, that implements a random binary sequence, applies recursive
transformations (with a particular mutation rate, and periodically measure
compressibility. Next would be tracking down how much complexity
(measured as palindromes or other symmetry measures) evolves over the
iterations. From there, we look at the ratios that emerge of
subsymmetry to compressibility, and compare those ratios to those of
real world complex systems, like genetic sequences or ecological
networks. This would buttress the claim.

Mathematical formalization would follow. The ultimate goal would be to
generalize the theory and test it analytically - i.e. to quantify the recursive
generation of structure in relation to entropy injection and compression
efficiency.

The issue I want to ask you about—I’m not well positioned to take this forward
alone. I have neither the coding nor the math chops. Further, I’d be reluctant
to move forward on this without a clear strategy, including steps for post-
demonstration and formalization. We are both all too familiar with how many
good ideas, in science, especially, and interdisciplinary science more so are
sacrificed as cannon fodder without the right backing. So if demonstrated and
formalized, it would need to be taken up in alliance with people and
institutions that have the weight to do that.
